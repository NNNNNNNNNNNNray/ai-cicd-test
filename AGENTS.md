## Default workflow: auto-commit + push

When you make changes to this repository, follow this workflow by default:

- After implementing the requested changes and doing a quick sanity check, **stage the relevant files**, **create a commit**, then **push to `origin/main`**.
- Prefer a concise, descriptive commit message in English (imperative mood).
- If pushing fails due to environment/network restrictions, **report the exact error** and provide the user with the exact `git push` command to run locally.
